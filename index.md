### Deep NLP for Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing digital text to determine if the emotional tone of the message is positive, negative, or neutral. For this project, I used PyTorch to develop a classifier and fine-tuned an IndoBERT model. I used this model to analyze more than 50K student feedback and predict their sentiment, allowing me to identify common complaints from students.

### Question Similarity Check

Question similarity check is the automated task to detecting similarity between a pair of questions. In this project, I build a NLP model to create vector representations for each question and used cosine similarity to determine the similarity between these vectors.

### Skin Cancer Segmentation

Skin cancer segmentation is a critical task in the diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer. In this project, I developed an automated method for accurately segmenting skin cancer images. Using the functional API in TensorFlow, I built a U-Net architecture model that effectively segmented the affected areas of skin. To evaluate the model's performance, I used the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric and the Dice coefficient, achieving impressive results that indicate the model's ability to accurately identify and segment skin cancer.
